*DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK*

*This task is about speech recognition system used to perform the user commands by recognising their voice.I have used the MIT APP INVERTER to develop a voice recognition system which recognises the user voice and perform the tasks what he asked for.We have to develop the code blocks and desired functionalities using pc or computer and have to connect it to our mobile phone through a scanner and we can control it using mobile phone.A speech recognition system is a technology that enables computers and devices to understand and process human speech, converting spoken words into a format that computers can understand and act upon, typically text or commands. This technology powers various applications like virtual assistants, transcription services. Speech recognition is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and computational linguistics that develops methodologies and technologies that enable the recognition and translation of spoken language into text by computers.Voice recognition technology can interpret speech and identify a single speaker. Like fingerprints, individual's have unique markers in their voices that technology can use to identify them. Many companies are already using this tool to authenticate that a person is indeed the individual they claim to be when speaking.
